# dyn-sys-analysis
 
Program containg basic tools for analysis of dynamical systems.
It is helpful to solve systems of first order ODEs and visualise them via time series,
poincare maps, phase diagrams and maybe more in future.

## dependencies
To use the program you need:
* Python 3
* numpy
* matplotlib
* scipy

## source files
The program consists of:
* main.py
* models.py
* tools.py
